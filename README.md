```

## üñ•Ô∏è GUI Components

### Main Form Setup

```powershell
# Import required .NET assemblies
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Drawing

# Create the main application window
$form = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.Form
$form.Text = "Wi-Fi Analyzer"
$form.Size = New-Object System.Drawing.Size(850, 600)
$form.StartPosition = "CenterScreen"
$form.Padding = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.Padding(15)
```

The GUI is built using .NET Windows Forms. This approach provides:
- Native Windows look and feel
- Rich text formatting capabilities
- Event-driven programming model

### Control Creation

```powershell
# Create buttons with enhanced visual properties
$scanButton = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.Button
$scanButton.Text = "Scan Wi-Fi"
$scanButton.Size = New-Object System.Drawing.Size(120, 35)
$scanButton.Location = New-Object System.Drawing.Point -ArgumentList 20, 20
$scanButton.Font = New-Object System.Drawing.Font("Segoe UI", 10)

# Create a RichTextBox for formatted output display
$outputBox = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.RichTextBox
$outputBox.Multiline = $true
$outputBox.ScrollBars = "Vertical"
$outputBox.Location = New-Object System.Drawing.Point -ArgumentList 20, 70
$outputBox.Size = New-Object System.Drawing.Size(790, 470)
$outputBox.Font = New-Object System.Drawing.Font("Consolas", 10)
$outputBox.BackColor = [System.Drawing.Color]::White
```

Key UI design decisions:
- **RichTextBox**: Chosen over standard TextBox to enable color-coding
- **Consolas font**: Selected for its monospaced properties for table alignment
- **Segoe UI**: Used for buttons and headers for enhanced readability

## üì° Network Scanning

### Get-WiFiScan Function

```powershell
function Get-WiFiScan {
    # Initialize variables
    $networks = @()
    $ssid = ""
    $security = ""
    
    # Execute netsh command to get WiFi information
    $output = netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid | Out-String
    $lines = $output -split "`r`n"

    # Process command output with regular expressions
    for ($i = 0; $i -lt $lines.Length; $i++) {
        $line = $lines[$i].Trim()

        # Extract SSID (network name)
        if ($line -match "^SSID\s+\d+\s*:\s*(.+)$") {
            $ssid = $matches[1].Trim()
            $security = "Unknown"
        }
        
        # Extract security type
        if ($line -match "Authentication\s*:\s*(.+)$") {
            $security = $matches[1].Trim()
        }

        # Extract BSSID and related properties
        if ($line -match "^BSSID\s+\d+\s*:\s*(.+)$") {
            $bssid = $matches[1].Trim()
            $signal = $null
            $channel = $null
            $width = $null

            # Look ahead in output for additional properties
            for ($j = 1; $j -le 8; $j++) {
                if ($i + $j -ge $lines.Length) { break }
                $nextLine = $lines[$i + $j].Trim()

                # Extract signal strength
                if ($nextLine -match "^Signal\s*:\s*(\d+)%") {
                    $signal = [int]$matches[1]
                }
                # Extract channel number
                elseif ($nextLine -match "^Channel\s*:\s*(\d+)$") {
                    $channel = [int]$matches[1]
                }
                # Extract channel width
                elseif ($nextLine -match "^Channel width\s*:\s*(.+)$") {
                    $width = $matches[1].Trim()
                }
            }

            # Create network object with all properties
            if ($ssid -and $bssid -and $signal -ne $null -and $channel -ne $null) {
                $networks += [PSCustomObject]@{
                    SSID      = if ($ssid) { $ssid } else { "[Hidden Network]" }
                    BSSID     = $bssid
                    Signal    = $signal
                    Channel   = $channel
                    Security  = $security
                    Width     = if ($width) { $width } else { "Standard" }
                    Band      = if ($channel -gt 14) { "5 GHz" } else { "2.4 GHz" }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return $networks
}
```

#### Implementation Details

1. **Command Execution**:
   - Uses `netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid` to retrieve detailed network information
   - The `mode=bssid` parameter is crucial for getting signal strength and channel data

2. **Parsing Strategy**:
   - Applies regex pattern matching to extract structured data
   - Uses a state machine approach to associate properties with the correct network
   - Looks ahead in the output to find properties that appear after each BSSID

3. **Data Enrichment**:
   - Automatically determines frequency band based on channel number
   - Provides default values for missing information
   - Handles hidden networks with a descriptive placeholder

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Only creates network objects when all required properties are present
   - Uses null-value checking to ensure data integrity

## üîç System Information

### Get-MACAddress Function

```powershell
function Get-MACAddress {
    # Get WiFi interface information
    $output = netsh wlan show interfaces | Out-String
    $lines = $output -split "`r`n"

    # Extract MAC address with regex
    foreach ($line in $lines) {
        if ($line -match "^\s*Physical address\s*:\s*([0-9a-fA-F:-]+)") {
            return $matches[1].Trim()
        }
    }
    return "Unavailable"
}
```

This function:
- Uses a different `netsh` command to get interface details
- Focuses only on extracting the MAC address
- Has a fallback return value for error cases

### Get-ComputerInfoExtras Function

```powershell
function Get-ComputerInfoExtras {
    # Get computer hostname
    $hostname = $env:COMPUTERNAME

    # Find active WiFi adapter
    $wifiAdapter = Get-NetAdapter -Physical | Where-Object {
        $_.Status -eq "Up" -and ($_.InterfaceDescription -match "Wireless" -or $_.Name -match "Wi-Fi")
    }

    $ip = $null

    # Get adapter's IPv4 address
    if ($wifiAdapter) {
        $ipEntry = Get-NetIPAddress -InterfaceIndex $wifiAdapter.ifIndex -AddressFamily IPv4 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
            Where-Object { $_.IPAddress -notlike "169.*" }

        if ($ipEntry) {
            $ip = $ipEntry.IPAddress
        }
    }

    return @{
        ComputerName = $hostname
        IPAddress    = if ($ip) { $ip } else { "Unavailable" }
    }
}
```

This function:
- Uses PowerShell's `Get-NetAdapter` cmdlet instead of `netsh`
- Filters for active wireless adapters
- Excludes link-local addresses (169.x.x.x)
- Returns multiple values in a hashtable

## üìä Channel Analysis

### Analyze-ChannelCongestion Function

```powershell
function Analyze-ChannelCongestion($networks) {
    # Initialize channel analysis hashtable
    $channelAnalysis = @{}
    
    # Separate networks by frequency band
    $networks24GHz = $networks | Where-Object { [int]$_.Channel -le 14 }
    $networks5GHz = $networks | Where-Object { [int]$_.Channel -gt 14 }
    
    # Process 2.4 GHz networks with channel overlap
    foreach ($network in $networks24GHz) {
        $channel = [int]$network.Channel
        $signal = [int]$network.Signal
        
        # Calculate affected channel range (+/- 4 channels)
        $startChannel = [Math]::Max(1, $channel - 4)
        $endChannel = [Math]::Min(14, $channel + 4)
        
        # Calculate impact on each affected channel
        for ($i = $startChannel; $i -le $endChannel; $i++) {
            $distance = [Math]::Abs($i - $channel)
            $impact = $signal * (1 - ($distance / 5))
            
            # Update channel congestion score
            if ($channelAnalysis.ContainsKey($i)) {
                $channelAnalysis[$i] += $impact
            } else {
                $channelAnalysis[$i] = $impact
            }
        }
    }
    
    # Process 5 GHz networks (simpler - less overlap)
    foreach ($network in $networks5GHz) {
        $channel = [int]$network.Channel
        $signal = [int]$network.Signal
        
        if ($channelAnalysis.ContainsKey($channel)) {
            $channelAnalysis[$channel] += $signal
        } else {
            $channelAnalysis[$channel] = $signal
        }
    }
    
    return $channelAnalysis
}
```

#### Channel Congestion Algorithm

The algorithm models real-world WiFi interference patterns by accounting for:

1. **Channel Overlap**: 
   - 2.4 GHz channels overlap significantly (+/- 4 channels)
   - Channel 6 affects channels 2-10, with diminishing impact

2. **Impact Formula**:
   ```
   Impact = Signal √ó (1 - (Distance √∑ 5))
   ```
   Where:
   - Signal = Network signal strength (0-100%)
   - Distance = Absolute difference from center channel
   - Division by 5 creates a linear diminishing effect

3. **Cumulative Scoring**:
   - Each channel's congestion score is the sum of all impacts
   - Higher scores indicate more congestion/interference

### Recommend-BestChannel Function

```powershell
function Recommend-BestChannel($networks) {
    # Handle empty networks case
    if ($networks.Count -eq 0) {
        return @{
            "2.4GHz" = "N/A"
            "5GHz" = "N/A"
            "CongestionData" = @{}
        }
    }
    
    # Get congestion data
    $congestion = Analyze-ChannelCongestion $networks
    
    # Separate and sort channels by band
    $channels24GHz = $congestion.GetEnumerator() | Where-Object { $_.Name -le 14 } | Sort-Object Name
    $channels5GHz = $congestion.GetEnumerator() | Where-Object { $_.Name -gt 14 } | Sort-Object Name
    
    # Find least congested channel in each band
    $best24GHz = if ($channels24GHz.Count -gt 0) { 
        $channels24GHz | Sort-Object Value | Select-Object -First 1 
    } else { 
        $null 
    }
    
    $best5GHz = if ($channels5GHz.Count -gt 0) { 
        $channels5GHz | Sort-Object Value | Select-Object -First 1 
    } else { 
        $null 
    }
    
    # Return recommendations for both bands
    return @{
        "2.4GHz" = if ($best24GHz) { $best24GHz.Name } else { "N/A" }
        "5GHz" = if ($best5GHz) { $best5GHz.Name } else { "N/A" }
        "CongestionData" = $congestion
    }
}
```

This function:
- Builds on the congestion analysis to recommend channels
- Separates channels by frequency band
- Sorts channels by congestion score
- Selects the least congested channel in each band
- Returns recommendations for both bands plus full congestion data

    # Initialize result data structure
    $testResults = @{
        DownloadSpeed = 0
        Latency = 0
        Status = "Failed"
        Details = ""
    }
    
    try {
        # Latency test with multiple fallback servers
        $pingServers = @("8.8.8.8", "167.206.19.3", "216.244.115.147")
        $pingSuccess = $false
        
        foreach ($server in $pingServers) {
            try {
                $ping = Test-Connection -ComputerName $server -Count 2 -ErrorAction Stop
                $avgLatency = ($ping | Measure-Object -Property ResponseTime -Average).Average
                $testResults.Latency = [math]::Round($avgLatency, 0)
                $pingSuccess = $true
                $testResults.Details += "Ping successful to $server. "
                break
            }
            catch {
                $testResults.Details += "Failed to ping $server. "
                continue
            }
        }
        
        if (-not $pingSuccess) {
            $testResults.Status = "Failed: All ping tests failed. Network connectivity may be limited."
            return $testResults
        }
        
        # Download speed test with multiple fallback URLs
        $downloadUrls = @(
            "http://speedtest.ftp.otenet.gr/files/test1Mb.db",
            "http://ipv4.download.thinkbroadband.com/1MB.zip",
            "https://proof.ovh.net/files/1Mb.dat"
        )
        
        $downloadSuccess = $false
        foreach ($url in $downloadUrls) {
            try {
                # Download test file and measure time
                $startTime = Get-Date
                $wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
                $wc.DownloadFile($url, "$env:TEMP\speedtest.tmp")
                $endTime = Get-Date
                
                # Calculate speed
                $fileSize = (Get-Item "$env:TEMP\speedtest.tmp").Length / 1MB

                    Remove-Item "$env:TEMP\speedtest.tmp" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
                    
                    # Update results
                    $testResults.DownloadSpeed = [math]::Round($downloadSpeed * 8, 2) # Convert to Mbps
                    $testResults.Status = "Success"
                    $testResults.Details += "Download test successful using $url. "
                    $downloadSuccess = $true
                    break
                }
            }
            catch {
                $testResults.Details += "Failed to download from $url. "
                continue
            }
        }
        
        if (-not $downloadSuccess) {
            $testResults.Status = "Partial: Latency test successful, but all download tests failed. Network may be restricted."
        }
        
        return $testResults
    }
    catch {
        $testResults.Status = "Failed: Unexpected error - $($_.Exception.Message)"
        return $testResults
    }
}
```

#### Speed Test Implementation

The function employs multiple techniques to ensure reliable testing:

1. **Latency Testing**:
   - Uses `Test-Connection` cmdlet (PowerShell's ping wrapper)
   - Tries multiple DNS servers with fallback logic
   - Calculates average response time

2. **Download Testing**:
   - Uses `System.Net.WebClient` for file downloads
   - Measures exact start and end times with millisecond precision
   - Calculates throughput based on file size and download time
   - Converts from MB/s to Mbps (√ó 8) for standard reporting

3. **Fallback Strategy**:
   - Multiple servers for latency testing
   - Multiple URLs for download testing
   - Continues even if latency test succeeds but download fails
   - Designed for educational network restrictions

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive try/catch blocks
   - Detailed status reporting
   - Returns partial results when possible
